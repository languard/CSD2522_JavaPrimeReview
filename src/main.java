/*
 * Java Review Assignment
 * Create a program that will find all prime numbers from 1 to 100,000
 * A prime number is larger than 1, and only divisible by 1 and itself
 * Each time a prime number is found it will be printed to the console
 * After all numbers have been found the total number of found primes will be reported as well as the time taken in miliseconds
 * For example, if finding the primes from 1 to 10 the output would look like this:
 * 2
 * 3
 * 5
 * 7
 * Primes found: 4
 * Time Taken: 0  (note: this is correct, the time to check primes between 1 and 10 is so fast most systems will report 0 miliseconds)
 *
 * There are 9,592 primes between 1 and 100,000.
 * All logic for finding and displaying primes must be in the PrimeCheck class
 * PrimeCheck.java us not allowed to have any static functions
 * Only main.java is allowed to have a static void main() function
 * User System.nanoTime() for timing
 * Remember that System.nanoTime() returns nanoseconds, so you will need to divide by 1,000,000 to get miliseconds
 * Remember that elegance doesn't matter unless you're going for the extra credit. The brute force solution
 * takes about 10ish lines of code and works just fine.
 * Timeing code must include all logic. The pseudocode would look something like this:
 * record start time
 * FindPrimes(100,000)
 * record stop time
 * calculate total time in miliseconds
 *
 * Extra Credit: 3pts if you allows for a command line argument to set the range
 * Extra Credit: 5pts (for 8 points total) if your code can process the primes up to 2,000,000 under 1 second on my computer.
 * For reference:
 * My time to find all primes up to 100,000 - around 55 miliseconds
 * My time to find all primes up to 2,000,000 - around 225 miliseconds
 * CPU differences will cause these times to vary, but not by large amounts. Final measurement will be done on an AMD Ryzen 5 9600x.
